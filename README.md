# Hello-world
Me and my stuff
<br>I'm a retired U.S. Army Soldier (22 years) and spent a lot of time in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, South Korea, Germany and a few other places. I now work for the government in a different capacity. I'm very interested in technology and have coded in HTML, Java, Visual Basic, etc.  I watch a lot of TED talks and love to learn about new ideas and see where we are heading. I like the idea of using technology to help people and sharing openly both software and open source hardware. I don't have any real "hobbies" as I'm very consumed with my work but I love to learn, every day.
